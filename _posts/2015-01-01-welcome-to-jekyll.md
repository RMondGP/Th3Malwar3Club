# Getting Started

Before we begin, please be aware that you need to understand some coding concepts and a little of website coding, such as CSS, HTML, or JS to potentially get this to work the way I did. 

The first thing you may need to do is get a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. They have a free account and the GitHub pages is free. Note: GitHub pages must be public.

## Step 1. Create a GitHub repository

1. Click on the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
2. Name your repository **`username.github.io`** (replace `username` with your GitHub username).
3. Set the repository to **Public** (GitHub Pages only works for public repositories on free accounts).
4. Click **Create repository**.

>		**Mind you my repository name is just the Th3Malwar3Club**

## Step 2: Download Obsidian

1. Go to the [Obsidian Website](https://obsidian.md/) 
2. Download and install the specific version for your machine

## Step 3: Setting up a Vault

Now setting up a vault is just a fancy word for creating a folder where you will place all your files. Instead of creating a folder through Obsidian, I went ahead and creating a folder in the place I wanted on my computer which was my D: drive.

1. Pick a location for your folder and name it the same as your GitHub repo
2. 


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

## section 1

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## section 2

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

$ a \* b = c ^ b $

$ 2^{\frac{n-1}{3}} $

$ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx. $

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
// prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
```
